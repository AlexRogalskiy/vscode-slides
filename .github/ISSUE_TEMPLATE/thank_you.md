## ‚ù§Ô∏è I'm using Slides

_Tell us how you're using it and what you really like about it!_

## If you want to help us

Have a look at [our contributing guide][contributing]. Contributions of any kind are welcome!

Here are few ideas:

- Use Slides to present at a local meetup or a conference
- [Rate Slides on the Marketplace][rate-slides]
- Share the link to your friends or colleagues
- Help out with issues ([list of good first issues][good-first-issues])
- Blog about the extension

If you do, let us know. We'd love to hear from you!

Thank you! üíê‚ú®
